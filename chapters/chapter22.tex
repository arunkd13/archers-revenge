\lettrine{A}{bout} five minutes after Aryan and Divya left, Divya got a phone
call on her cell phone.

“Hello… What?… Yes… But… OK…” was all she said. She
disconnected the call.

“Aryan, I need you to drop me at Tirumangalam junction. I'll have to go home”,
Divya told Aryan in a loud voice so that it was audible amidst the sound of
the bike and the traffic.

“Are you out of your mind? We have to go back to our hideout in the hills by
tonight at any cost. Staying back in Chennai is very risky. Both our lives are
at stake”, Aryan shouted back.

“I… My mother needs to be admitted to the hospital immediately, and I need
to be there”, Divya said.

“It's dangerous to stay back in this city, Divya. We may get caught anytime”,
Aryan said.

“I need to go, there is no other option.”

“OK. I'll drop you there, and I'll go back to the hotel. Both of us will leave for
Tirupati tomorrow morning.”

“Right now, I don't know how long I need to stay. You go back to the hills. I'll
join you as soon as possible.”

Aryan couldn't make her change her mind about going home. Divya was as adamant as ever. He
raced to the location she wanted him to drop her at and stopped the bike. She got
down and looked at him.

Aryan said, “Come back as soon as possible. Don't use public transport to travel
to Tirupati. Do you have a bike?”

Divya said, “Yes, I have a Scooty.”

Aryan said, “OK. Even if takes a whole day, come back on your Scooty. Also, don't venture out for a long
time in public places. Try to stay inside your house or at the hospital, as
far as possible.”

“OK. See you soon”, she said and turned to cross the road.

Aryan continued to look at her as she walked away for a few more seconds. He
suddenly felt alone and vulnerable. Divya was more than just a partner in
crime—she was a companion he could rely on. She made him feel confident and
stronger. For the first time, he wished all this was over soon.

He then started his long journey towards Tirupati.
