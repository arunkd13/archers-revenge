\lettrine{E}{ven} though Guru, the minister, had initiated investigations
through the police, he rightly guessed that, his personal
investigations might be more useful in identifying the suspects. Only he knew
his enemies—and, more importantly, his crimes.

Initially, it was difficult for him to guess who might have been behind the
assassination attempt. Not that he had no enemies—in his profession, everyone
was a friend one day and an enemy the next. People frequently oscillated between
friendship and enmity, based on their commercial interests and Guru's position.
Hence, any of his “associates” or “well-wishers” could have been behind the
assassination attempt. Except in rare cases, even in his profession of politics,
people didn't kill others due to commercial losses or power struggles. Besides,
it was difficult to get away with murder. Hence, he ruled out professional and
commercial motivations.

He thought about all the recent crimes he had committed. All of them were
related to money, except one from a few months ago, when he killed three people to
take control over the Ministry of Renewable Energy. A personal loss, of
a loved one, could be a powerful motivation for revenge.

He asked his people to conduct some preliminary investigations on the immediate
family members of the people he had killed. At least in one case—Aryan's—there
was sufficient cause for suspicion. Aryan had tried to register a police
complaint and the minister had sent his men to silence him. One of his men
contacted the University where Aryan was studying and was informed that Aryan
had applied for a long leave on health grounds. His apartment at New Delhi had
been locked for the last couple of months and the neighbours hadn't seen him
around during that time. No one knew where he was.

The minister wondered if he should have had Aryan killed, instead of just having
him threatened by his men. But there were no signs of any violence from that kid
back then—he had made sure Aryan was sufficiently shaken up. And yet here he
was—trying to kill him with a bow and arrow. The minister had discovered Aryan's
background in archery training and was able to make the connection with the way
he had been attacked.

Inspector Samara Simha Reddy had already arranged a thorough check of the
spot where the murder was attempted. Apart from the nail cluster which was used to
puncture the tyres of the car and a couple of arrows, they could not recover
anything else. There were no fingerprints on either of the objects—whoever
attacked was probably wearing gloves. There was no body, blood, or any other clue
that could lead to the suspects.

Just as the inspector was pondering over how to proceed with the case, he
received a call from the minister who informed him about the probable suspect.
But the minister didn't tell him about the context of the crime or why Aryan was
trying to kill him.

Anyway, it didn't take long for the inspector to figure it out. In India, it may
be possible to escape conviction for a crime, if one had enough money and
influence or at least delay the judicial process. But it is impossible to stop
the truth from circulating. The inspector only had to talk to a couple of his
friends and their contacts in Delhi and do a little research to establish the
circumstances and motivations behind the crime. What happened now was an attempt
to take revenge on the minister for the murders committed by him a few months
back.

Now that the inspector knew the truth, he
could use it to demand more payment from the minister, eventually.
