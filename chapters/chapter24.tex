\lettrine{T}{he} next day, Divya left for Tirupati from the Chennai Central
Railway Station by train. She used to love train journeys—it brought her back
memories of her yearly childhood trips. Like then, she sat at her favourite
window seat and indulged in her favourite activity—getting a glimpse of nature,
civilization, and people. As her journey progressed, she could no longer concentrate
on the outside. She was totally preoccupied with her inner thoughts and reflections.
What was she doing?  Was she going in the right path? Playing with others'
lives—is that the correct thing to do? How long will she have to continue with
this double game? What would she gain by playing this dangerous game? Will all
this trouble be worth it in the end?

There were so many questions that were ringing in her mind, but the answers were
not as forthcoming. She now realized how simple those questions in her college
exams were—at least there were clear answers. The exam of life, however, seemed
to be much more complex. In the path she had chosen, lives were at stake. She
didn't know if she was strong enough to deal with the consequences of her
actions. But she realized she didn't have options before her now—she had already
chosen her path and would have to complete the task at hand. The rest, she would
decide later. Everything needed a thorough reconsideration.

She was so immersed in her thoughts that the train had already reached the
Tirupati railway station, before she knew. Three hours of journey felt like
three minutes. Divya got down at the station and was crossing the main gate when
she saw two ladies in churidars getting down from a jeep. They looked in her
direction for a couple of seconds and then walked towards her. Only when they
were a couple of feet away, did it hit her that they could be policewomen in
plain clothes. It was too late to escape.  Before Divya could react, they held
her by her arms from either side and dragged her towards the jeep.

“Who are you? Why are you dragging me?” Divya protested and tried to free her
arms. But they were stronger, and the grip was firm.

“You need to come with us to the police station,” the woman replied.

“Why should I? Do you have an arrest warrant?” she asked.

“We don't need a warrant to question people. Just keep quiet and come with us;
otherwise you'll invite more trouble,” the other woman replied and handcuffed
her from behind.

“Why are you handcuffing me? Just remove them now or—” Divya shouted.

They were in no mood to listen to her, and continued dragging her towards the
jeep. They threw her in and closed the door. There were two male constables in
uniform waiting inside the jeep. They drove her to the police station. Divya
remembered Aryan's suggestion not to use public transport or roam around in
public places—she cursed herself for forgetting that crucial bit of advice. Upon
reaching the police station, they took her to one of the cells, tied both her
hands behind a chair, switched off the lights, and locked the door from outside.
She tried calling them, but there was no reply. Unlike other cells that had bars
and one could look outside, this one had an opaque door. After a short time,
Divya became tired of shouting and fell asleep on the chair in the interrogation
room.

Divya woke up as water splashed on her face. She had no idea how long she had
slept. The lights had been switched on, and she could see the two lady
constables in front of her. Both of them held a bucket of water. One bucket
was empty—probably that was the one just emptied on her, she thought, feeling
the water dripping from her face. The second constable stepped forward and
splashed another bucket of water on Divya's face with great force. Divya jerked
back and could not see anything for a couple of seconds until the water dripped
away. The inspector walked in and asked the women to leave.

“Who are you, and why are you trying to kill the minister?” the inspector asked.

Divya turned her head sideways in defiance, not wanting to answer.

The inspector slapped her. Since she had never beaten by anyone, not even her
parents, Divya felt a shock-wave pass through her body. The pain of an
experienced police inspector slapping her was too much. She turned towards him
and opened her mouth to say something.

He slapped her again. This time, his fingers hit her lips causing them to
collide with her teeth. The force of the impact cut her lips and blood started
flowing from them.  She broke down and her eyes were filled with tears.

The inspector allowed a few seconds to pass before saying, “If you remain
silent or if you lie while answering my questions, I'll slap you twice as hard
as this—is that clear?” He raised his voice while uttering those last three
words.

She nodded her head.

The inspector asked, “Who are you, and why did you attack the minister?”

Divya replied, “I didn't want to attack the minister. My boyfriend attacked him
because the minister killed his father. He wants to avenge his father's death—I
was just helping him.”

“By just helping him, you have attempted murder. Do you have any idea how many
years you two will be locked up in prison?” the inspector asked.

Divya was silent.

“What are your names? Where is he now?” the inspector asked.

“My name is Divya. His name is Aryan. He lives in a small house in the forest, in
the Tirupati hills. Please leave me—I am innocent. It was Aryan who planned
and executed everything. I was just doing what he asked me to. Please let me
go,” she pleaded with tearful eyes.

“OK. We'll let you go,” the inspector said after a brief pause.

Aryan was surfing the net when Divya entered the makeshift home. He saw Divya
standing next to the door. He beamed and said, “Welcome home. Good to see you
once again. Did you notice the newspapers, TV channels, and news sites? All of
them are talking about our attack the other day. I am sure it was a huge blow
to the minister especially on the eve of the elections. I think we have succeeded in our
efforts to connect the minister with the murders. Reporters are already
investigating that line. I hope the police will also start investigating soon
and arrest him.”

Divya stood quietly and did not reply.

How did you come?” Aryan asked, and looked at the computer.

“I came by train,” she said and sat down on the floor.

“You came by train? I told you not to travel by bus or train—it's risky. The
police may be monitoring those places by now,” he said.

She didn't reply. Her silence made him feel jittery. He turned around and saw
her sitting down. She had covered her face with her hands. He got up from the
chair, went to her and removed her hands from her face. Her eyes were filled
with tears, and she did not look up.

“What happened, Divya?” he asked. She remained silent.

Aryan noticed some movement and turned to look outside the door. There were
at least six policemen standing with their rifles pointed towards him. He
realized the gravity of the situation as a chill went down his spine.
