\chapter{About the Author}

Destination Infinity is the online identity of Rajesh Kollu, who is basically a
'Professional' Blogger living in Chennai, India. He has an opinion on everything
and is an expert on nothing!

He was forced to become an author because people kept pestering him with the
lethal question, "What do you do?".

When he answered, "I am a professional blogger", people usually persisted with
questions like, "What is a professional blogger? I have never heard of this? Do
you know anyone who is \emph{also} a professional blogger? Would anyone in their
right senses become a professional blogger? You quit your \emph{plum} sales
career for this? Do you earn anything from your work? How do you eat?", etc.

Now, since (at least) one of his books has been (self) published, as an e-book
and in a hand made print edition, he can safely say, "I am an author, I write
book(s)". With that one sentence, he aims to eliminate any further questions,
especially the "Do you earn anything out of your work?" ones.

Because, it's quite normal to be an author and not be earning anything at all!! \faGrinBeam[regular]
