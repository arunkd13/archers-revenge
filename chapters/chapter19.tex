\lettrine{A}{ryan} and Divya rode from Chennai to Tirupati (around 160 KM) on their bike.
They took a few breaks on the way as the journey was long and tiresome. They
reached Tirupati, parked the bike at the Tirupati Railway Station and walked up.
It took them couple of hours to reach their makeshift house amidst the jungle in
the hills. They reached at 4:00 in the morning, collapsed on their respective
beds, and slept off. Being exhausted by the long travel they slept until late
afternoon.

The next evening, Divya went to the neighbouring stream for her bath while Aryan
gathered some firewood and vegetables for cooking. He walked downhill to buy
newspapers. By the time he was back, Divya had cooked meals—rice, boiled
vegetables, and curry.

Divya browsed news on the net while Aryan scoured through the newspapers to read
the news about their activity on the previous day.

Aryan said, “Except for a small mention in a couple of newspapers, no one else
has reported our attack.”

“There is no mention of the attack on the news websites either. Probably the
Minister used his influence to stop the news from getting reported,” Divya said.
She seemed thoughtful but was not surprised.

“We are committing a crime against him. Why should he be afraid of that being
reported?” Aryan asked.

“He will not want any negative publicity, at least until the elections get over.
Besides, he may not want any rumours about the motive behind the attack,” Divya
said.

“But he could have used it for his advantage. He could have claimed that the
attack was a planned assault by the opposition parties. Since they didn't have
any hopes of winning the elections against him, they decided to eliminate him
this way. He could have said that he was committed to serving the people
regardless of the threat to his life—he valued the welfare of the people more
than his life. That might fetch additional votes for him,” Aryan said.

“That's what every politician does—blame the opposition for anything that goes
wrong. People won't believe that lie. Did the newspapers report any injuries?”
Divya asked.

“No. For the kind of blunt of arrowheads we used, I don't think even a crow, if
it had come accidentally on the way, would have been hurt. Forget people getting
injured. This feels like cowardice to me. Next time, we should not attack like
this. We should get into his range, look straight into his eyes, and pierce an
arrow right through his heart,” Aryan said.

“What are the chances we'll be able to get into his range, attack him, and escape
from the scene?” Divya asked.

“If we monitor his activities and plan properly, I think we can do that. We
almost got him in the hills earlier,” Aryan said.

“That was because it was a personal visit and there was less security. After all
the ruckus we have created, I am sure security arrangements will be very tight
from now. We may not be able to get anywhere close to him without getting
caught,” Divya said.

“What do we do? We keep launching arrows towards the sky and hope that one of
them will accidentally hit him? We might as well launch one from right here and
hope for a miracle,” Aryan mocked.

Divya said, “Relax. If your enemy is more powerful than you, there is no point
in fighting them directly. You should first weaken them, make them vulnerable,
and then strike. We have just created fear in the Minister's mind. He will
feel vulnerable every moment from now on. Our next move will weaken his position
considerably.”

Aryan said, “You got an idea for the next attack already?”

Divya said, “Yes. By taking so much effort to prevent the attack from being
covered by the media, the minister has unintentionally exposed his weakness.
We'll now use it to the fullest.”

Aryan said, “I hope our next attack will be slightly more purposeful and
effective than the last one. Please remember that we are risking our lives and
may get caught anytime.”

Divya said, “Yes. We are going to attack the very source of his power to weaken
him. Only if he becomes weak and vulnerable, we can take him down. Can you make
a list of all his major election campaigns during the next one month?”
