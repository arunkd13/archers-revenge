\lettrine{A}{ryan} and Divya rode from Chennai to Tirupati, a distance of around
160 km, on their bike.  They took a few breaks on the way, as the journey was
long and tiresome. They reached Tirupati, parked the bike at the Tirupati
railway station and walked up.  It took them a couple of hours to reach their
makeshift house amidst the jungle in the hills. They reached at 4:00 in the
morning, collapsed on their respective beds, and fell asleep. Being exhausted by
the long travel, they slept until late afternoon.

It was evening soon and Divya went to the neighbouring stream for her bath, while Aryan
gathered some firewood and vegetables for cooking. He walked downhill to buy
newspapers. By the time he was back, Divya had cooked a meal—rice, boiled
vegetables, and curry.

Divya browsed the news on the internet while Aryan scoured through the newspapers to read
the news about their activity on the previous day.

Aryan said, “Except for a small mention in a couple of newspapers, no one else
has reported our attack.”

“There is no mention of the attack on the news websites either. Probably the
minister used his influence to stop the news from being reported,” Divya said.
She seemed thoughtful but was not surprised.

“We are committing a crime against him. Why should he be afraid of that being
reported?” Aryan asked.

“He will not want any negative publicity, at least until the elections are over.
Even though he is on the receiving end, there will be rumours about the motive
behind the attack,” Divya said.

“But he could have used it to his advantage. He could have claimed that the
attack was a planned assault by the opposition parties. Since they didn't have
any hopes of winning the elections against him, they decided to eliminate him
this way. He could have said that he was committed to serving the people
regardless of the threat to his life—he valued the welfare of the people more
than his life. That might fetch him additional votes,” Aryan said.

“That's what every politician does—blame the opposition for anything that goes
wrong. People won't believe that lie. Did the newspapers report any injuries?”
Divya asked.

“No. For the kind of blunt arrowheads we used, I don't think even a crow, if
it had come accidentally in the way, would have been hurt. Forget people getting
injured. This feels like cowardice to me. Next time, we should not attack like
this. We should get into his range, look straight into his eyes, and pierce an
arrow right through his heart,” Aryan said.

“What are the chances we'll be able to get into his range, attack him, and escape
from the scene?” Divya asked.

“If we monitor his activities and plan properly, I think we can do that. We
almost got him in the hills earlier,” Aryan said.

“That was because it was a personal visit and there was less security. After all
the ruckus we have created, I am sure security arrangements will be very tight
from now on. We may not be able to get anywhere close to him without getting
caught,” Divya said.

“What do we do? We keep launching arrows towards the sky and hope that one of
them will accidentally hit him? We might as well launch one from right here and
hope for a miracle,” Aryan mocked.

Divya said, “Relax. If your enemy is more powerful than you, there is no point
in fighting them directly. You should first weaken them, make them vulnerable,
and then strike. We have just created fear in the minister's mind. He will
feel vulnerable every moment from now on. Our next move will weaken his position
considerably.”

Aryan said, “You got an idea for the next attack already?”

Divya said, “Yes. By taking so much effort to prevent the attack from being
covered by the media, the minister has unintentionally exposed his weakness.
We'll now use it to the fullest.”

Aryan said, “I hope our next attack will be slightly more purposeful and
effective than the last one. Please remember that we are risking our lives and
could get caught anytime.”

Divya said, “Yes. We are going to attack the very source of his power to weaken
him. Only if he becomes weak and vulnerable, can we can him down. Can you make
a list of all his major election campaigns during the next one month?”
