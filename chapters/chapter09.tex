\lettrine{A}{fter} two weeks of walking up and down, Aryan finally set up his new house on
the hills. He bought only those items that were necessary. He bought a foldable
table and a plastic chair to work on his laptop and to eat meals. He bought
basic cutlery, crockery items, and utensils to store grains, vegetables, and
cook food. He made a solar cooker to boil rice and vegetables. He set up a
wood-fired stove with a few stones and collected firewood from nearby trees to
make fire. He covered the main door and windows with curtains. He bought
mattresses and pillows to sleep.

He attached two solar panels over the roof to generate electricity during the
day. He bought batteries that stored the power generated by the solar panels to
power a couple of LED lamps (during the night) and charge his laptop and cell
phone. He dug a pit where he installed a compost-able toilet. He took bath and
washed clothes in the nearby stream. The stream also provided him with abundant
fresh water – he boiled some for drinking.

He visited shops on the new walking route to buy rice, vegetables, and other
supplies. He started to grow vegetables around his new home and got many fruits
from the surrounding trees. He stocked as much supplies as possible and tried his
best to reduce the reliance on the outside world - he didn't want to attract
unnecessary attention coming into and walking out of the forest regularly.

He now focused his attention on practising archery and making plans for his
attack. With a weak cellular signal, he was able to connect to 2G Internet. He
bought newspapers and magazines whenever he went out. He followed all the
movements of the Minister online and offline. He bought books on archery to
learn more about the attack strategies used by archers during ancient times.

After a few weeks, his anticipated moment finally arrived – the Minister was
coming to Tirupati on his birthday and newspapers/websites featured the news
prominently. He anticipated that the Minister's security cover would be minimum
and hence formed a plan to kill the Minister while he was on his way down. But
he did not expect the turn of events, as they happened.
